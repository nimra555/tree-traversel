# What is Tree Traversel?
Tree is a hierarchical data structure which stores the information naturally in the form of hierarchy unlike linear data structures like, Linked List, Stack, etc. A tree contains nodes(data) and connections(edges) which should not form a cycle.

######Following are the few frequently used terminologies for Tree data structure.

*Node — A node is a structure which may contain a value or condition, or represent a separate data structure.
Root — The top node in a tree, the prime ancestor.
Child — A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root, an immediate descendant.
Parent — The converse notion of a child, an immediate ancestor.
Leaf — A node with no children.
Internal node — A node with at least one child.
Edge — The connection between one node and another.
Depth — The distance between a node and the root.
Level — the number of edges between a node and the root + 1
Height — The number of edges on the longest path between a node and a descendant leaf.
Breadth — The number of leaves.
Sub Tree — A tree T is a tree consisting of a node in T and all of its descendants in T.
